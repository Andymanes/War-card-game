/*
!!!! STEP ONE !!!!
- Will need to make a deck of cards
    - all 4 suits
    - all 13 values for each suit
        - thinking an array for each maybe?

!!!! STEP TWO !!!!
- Find a way to shuffle the deck
    - thinking a for loop with the suits and values arrays but dont
      know what that will be yet
        - Math.floor(Math.random()).... something probably

!!!! STEP 3 !!!!
- Assign half of the shuffled deck to player 1 and the other half 
  to player 2
    - probably want some kind of a function called "deal" that will do this
      that can be called on later to restart the game

!!!! STEP 4 !!!! - Should probably do this before step 3
- create 2 players
    - Objects?
    - variables?

!!!! STEP 5 !!!!
