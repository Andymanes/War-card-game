/*
!!!! STEP ONE !!!!
- Will need to make a deck of cards
    - all 4 suits
    - all 13 values for each suit
        - thinking an array for each maybe?

!!!! STEP TWO !!!!
- Find a way to shuffle the deck
    - thinking a for loop with the suits and values arrays but dont
      know what that will be yet
        - Math.floor(Math.random()).... something probably

!!!! STEP 3 !!!!
- Assign half of the shuffled deck to player 1 and the other half 
  to player 2
    - probably want some kind of a function called "deal" that will do this
      that can be called on later 

!!!! STEP 4 !!!! - Should probably do this before step 3
- create 2 players
    - Objects?
    - variables?

!!!! STEP 5 !!!!
- begin creating play table
    - assign player 1 to the left
    - assign player 2 to the right

!!!! STEP 6 !!!!
- Create "flip cards" button that has JS functionality
    - reveal 1 card from each pile
    - calculates the highest card
    - puts both cards in the winners "remaining deck" pile
        - updates total of cards in "remaining deck" for each player

!!!! STEP 7 !!!!
- incorporate a tie scenario to the JS
    - incorporate appropriate functions/calculations for when this happens
    - acquire headache

!!!! STEP 8 !!!!
- add win condition 

!!!! STEP 9 !!!!
- add "new game" button that resets the entire board to back the beginning

!!!! STEP 10 !!!!
- make it pretty with CSS
