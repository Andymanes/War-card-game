WAR! A game of attrition
    - players do battle against one another by flipping over the top card in their deck
    - the high card takes their opponents card and puts both cards in the bottom of their deck
    - if there is a tie, players escalate to war by placing 3 cards facedown then revealing a 4th card
    - the high card from that reveal then takes all of the cards wagered by their opponent
